## Memory Game Project
A memory game is a game that requires observation, concentration and a good memory to win. Such games help us to increase our cognitive skills and thinking process. It avoids boredom and brings joy in our mind.

The project was created by me and Het Patel as part of 3rd Semester WDW project. It uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. The page is responsive and can be played in any screen. The page has several sections like introduction, advantages of games, rules of the game and the game itself. At the end it also contains feedback form to provide feedback. They can be navigated by navbar on top. Our game has a deck of paired cards with icons on them. The game is very simple: you have to match the cards with same icons in minimum possible moves. After the game ends a popup appears showing our moves, time taken and rating based on the moves used.
### Rules of the game:
  - In a deck of paired cards, the player needs to match each pair to win the game.
  - You can start the game by clicking on any card.
  - The timer will start as soon as you open a pair of cards.
  - Try to remember the unmatched cards and match them together as fast as possible with minimum possible moves.
  - Once you match the paired cards they will remain open until the end.
  - The matched cards are shown in green color, opening unmatched cards will be shown in red and will be closed again, and the single opened card in blue color.
  - The game ends once all cards are matched.
  - Your rating will be based on your moves used to complete the game.
  - If you want to restart the game you can press restart icon or press `Play again` button after one game ends in the popup window.
